Simple workflow to be used with Airmail


###Compose new email

This will switch over to Airmail and open a compose window.  
If you're using Airmail 2.0 please download the workflow labled 2.0. Airmail 2.0 has menu changes that affect how the workflow function.


###Search Unified inbox

Trigger: search {query}

Switches to Airmails unified inbox and puts focus on the search field. The query copies to your clipboard
so you can paste it into the field. Thanks to [David Ferguson](http://www.alfredforum.com/user/10-david-ferguson/) in the Alfred 
forums for the help.

*Note:* If the search is currently active the search query wont trigger.

###Search by subject

Trigger: subject {query}

Similar to the above search, the context of subject is added before the search

###Search by starred

Trigger: starred {query}

Enables the starred filter prior to search. Remember to switch off the starred filer when search is complete by hitting "2"
